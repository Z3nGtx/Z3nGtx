\# Assignment 1 : Data preparation\


# Download heart dataset from following link. # https://www.kaggle.com/zhaoyingzhu/heartcsv # Perform following operation on given dataset. # 1. Find Shape of Data
# 2. Find Missing Values
# 3. Find data type of each column # 4. Finding out Zero's
# 5. Find Mean age of patients
# 6. Now extract only Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, Chol.
# Randomly divide dataset in training (75%) and testing (25%).
# Through the diagnosis test I predicted 100 report as COVID positive, but only 45 of those
# total 500 samples. Create confusion matrix based on above data and find I. Accuracy II.
# Precision III. Recall IV. F-1 score
